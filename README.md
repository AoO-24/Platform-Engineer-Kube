Kubernetes is one of the primary ways you can implement Platform Engineering.



As you build a platform for engineers/developers who have requested to use it, you’ll have a few different options to do so. It’ll require several pieces. Just to list a few out:

An API

A CLI

A method of deploying resources

A method to deploy clusters

Management and deployment of containers

IaC tools like Terraform

Deploying and managing VMs



Although that seems like a lot, it’s the common “stack” for what’s used in many environments today.

With that list alone, you’re looking at roughly 6-8 different tools and an entirely different platform just to run VMs if you also have containers to deploy. That’s multiple tools, a full virtualized environment (ESXi, Hyper-V, etc.), and a container solution.

Using Kubernetes, you can have all methods in one place.



With tools/methods like Operators, Kubevirt, Cluster API, and Crossplane, Kubernetes can be THEE underlying platform of choice.



Think about it - you can do everything from creating VM's to deploying resources outside of Kubernetes and managing all of it in a declarative fashion.



In this 3-part course, you will learn about:

1. How to build a Kubernetes cluster as an underlying platform.

2. How to implement platform capabilities.

3. How to interact with the platform
