# Platform-Engineer On Kubernetes

Build A Platform Engineering Environment On Kubernetes From Scratch
1. Build a Kubernetes cluster as an underlying platform.
2. Implement platform capabilities.
3. Interact with the platform

Using Kubernetes, we can have all methods in one place.
With tools/methods like Operators, Kubevirt, Cluster API, and Crossplane, Kubernetes can be THEE underlying platform of choice.
Think about it - you can do everything from creating VM's to deploying resources outside of Kubernetes and managing all of it in a declarative fashion.

Kubernetes is one of the primary ways you can implement Platform Engineering.

As you build a platform for engineers/developers who have requested to use it, you’ll have a few different options to do so. It’ll require several pieces. Just to list a few out:

An API

A CLI

A method of deploying resources

A method to deploy clusters

Management and deployment of containers

IaC tools like Terraform

Deploying and managing VMs
